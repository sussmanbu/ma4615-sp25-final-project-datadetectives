# Blog post 1
This is DataDetectives' second blog post, where we dive into detail regarding one of the data sets we looked at in the past blog post.



### Exploring Economic and Health Trends with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

After much discussion, our team has selected Dataset #3, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), for our analysis. This dataset, managed by the Bureau of Labor Service, tracks thousands of respondents over several decades, beginning in 1979 when they were aged 14 to 18. The survey covers a vast range of socioeconomic factors, including employment trends, income disparities, and family dynamics. With thousands of variables available, we plan to utilize the online data selection tool to extract key information that can help answer important questions: What factors contribute to upward economic mobility? How do income and employment differ across gender, race, and education levels? Are there persistent racial disparities in long-term wealth accumulation? While the depth of the dataset is impressive, visualizing trends may require proportion-based analysis rather than direct numerical comparisons due to the complexity of the data.

To ensure accurate and meaningful insights, we have outlined a structured data parsing and cleaning approach. Since the dataset primarily consists of numeric codes representing different categorical values, our first step is decoding these into readable formats. Next, we will filter out non-interviewed individuals—those who have dropped out of the study due to reasons such as death or refusal to participate. Additionally, we will focus on data from the year 2010, removing records from 2009 and 2011 to streamline our analysis. This approach allows us to concentrate on a single pivotal year, avoiding potential inconsistencies introduced by overlapping time periods.

Given the project's requirements, we are also considering integrating a second dataset to enhance our analysis. One promising option is incorporating health-related data, including health conditions, insurance coverage, and healthcare usage. This could allow us to examine correlations between employment history and healthcare access, particularly in the wake of significant events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the Affordable Care Act’s early years. Additionally, with the swine flu epidemic occurring in 2009, analyzing its impact on healthcare trends in 2010 could yield valuable insights. By combining economic and health-related factors, we aim to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how socioeconomic conditions influence long-term well-being.
